# -Caltrans-Project-Construction-Stormwater-Report
Project for a CalTrans Client to Simplify Storm Water Reports


This project is an update/replacement of the Caltrans “Project Construction Stormwater Review Report”.  That report is a PDF that allows Caltrans field inspectors to gather data, note findings (issues needing corrective action), add pictures to those findings, be sent to the company’s Resident Engineer (RE), allows that RE to make corrections to the found issues, and attach pictures of those corrections. Our project replaces that PDF with an HTML5, and JavaScript based web form, which does not require an internet connection, which is used by the Caltrans inspector for all of their data gathering, and then outputs a PDF report which is sent to the RE for the corrective actions and RE data entry.  It runs on any modern standard compliant web browser, regardless of operating system and outputs the PDF report which can be emailed to an RE.
